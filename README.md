# Calculus

This repository contains the notes and exercises that I have been doing to learn calculus.

I am using the [Paul's Online Math Notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/) as a reference to study and write my notes.

## Topics Covered

The repository will be organized by two main folders, Calculus 1 and Calculus 2. In each folder, there will be two subfolders, `notes` and `exercises`. The `notes` folder will contain the notes that I have been writing, and the `exercises` folder will contain the exercises that I have been doing.
