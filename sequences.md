## Definition

First of all, let's define what a sequence is in an informal way.

A sequence is a list of numbers written in a specific order. It may or may not have an infinite number of terms.

Sequence terms are denoted as follow:

$$a_1 - first \space term$$

$$a_2 - second \space term$$

$$\vdots$$

$$a_n - n^{th} \space term$$

$$a_{n+1} - (n+1)^{st} \space term$$

$$\vdots$$

## Notation

A sequence can be represented in a few different ways. The most common ones are:

$$\lbrace a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n, a_{n+1}, \cdots \rbrace \quad \lbrace a_n \rbrace \quad \lbrace a_n \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty}$$

In the second and third notations, $a_n$ is usually given by a formula.
