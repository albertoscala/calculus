## Definition

First of all, let's define what a sequence is in an informal way.

A sequence is a list of numbers written in a specific order. It may or may not have an infinite number of terms.

Sequence terms are denoted as follow:

$$
a_1 - first term \newline
a_2 - second term \newline
. \newline
. \newline
. \newline
a_n - n^{th} term \newline
a_{n+1} - (n+1)^{st} term \newline
. \newline
. \newline
. \newline
$$
