## Definition

First of all, let's define what a sequence is in an informal way.

A sequence is a list of numbers written in a specific order. It may or may not have an infinite number of terms.

Sequence terms are denoted as follow:

$$a_1 - first \space term$$

$$a_2 - second \space term$$

$$\vdots$$

$$a_n - n^{th} \space term$$

$$a_{n+1} - (n+1)^{st} \space term$$

$$\vdots$$
