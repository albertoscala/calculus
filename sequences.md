## Definition

First of all, let's define what a sequence is in an informal way.

A sequence is a list of numbers written in a specific order. It may or may not have an infinite number of terms.

Sequence terms are denoted as follow:

$$a_1 - first \space term$$

$$a_2 - second \space term$$

$$\vdots$$

$$a_n - n^{th} \space term$$

$$a_{n+1} - (n+1)^{st} \space term$$

$$\vdots$$

## Notation

A sequence can be represented in a few different ways. The most common ones are:

$$\lbrace a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n, a_{n+1}, \cdots \rbrace \quad \lbrace a_n \rbrace \quad \lbrace a_n \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty}$$

In the second and third notations, $a_n$ is usually given by a formula.

**Examples**

To understand better the concept of sequences, let's calculate the first 5 terms of the following sequences:

1. $\lbrace \frac{n + 1}{n^2} \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty} = \lbrace 2, \frac{3}{4}, \frac{4}{9}, \frac{5}{16}, \frac{6}{25}, \cdots \rbrace$

2. $\lbrace \frac{(-1)^{n + 1}}{2^n} \rbrace_{n=1}^{\infty} = \lbrace -1, \frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{8}, -\frac{1}{16}, \cdots \rbrace$
